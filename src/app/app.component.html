  Example of Angular 6 application with lazy loading where lazy loaded views are nested in a
parent one using router-outlet. It shows an angular issue as the third nested view is not working.

<div style="margin:0;padding:20px;background-color:#EEE">
  <a routerLink="/lazy1">Load lazy 1</a>
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</div>
